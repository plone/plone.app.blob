  if the file field is primary.
  [davisagli]

- Fix BLOB migration when LinguaPlone is installed.
  Also for ATFile.

  CAUTION: when the fix was discussed with witsch,
  he pointed to the fact that the files would be
  entirely loaded in memory during migration.
  This could potentially eat too much memory.
  [gotcha]

- Don't fail on obscure chars in filename
  [tomgross]

  [aclark, garbas]

1.5.3 (2012-09-20)
------------------

- Update mutator to take care of filename in keyword args.
  [gotcha]

- Check for unicode filename first in ``index_html``.
  [vangheem]


1.5.2 (2012-05-25)
------------------

- Deprecated aliases were replaced on tests.
  [hvelarde]

- Keep the acquisition context of the blob in index_html, as otherwise
  we cannot get the http__etag method.
  [maurits]

- Move download implementation (the ``index_html`` method) to the blob
  wrapper class. The wrapper object is now directly viewable via the
  Zope 2 publisher.

  This change adds support for publishing of the original image data
  for any image field via the scaling view (even for fields that have
  been added via schema extension).

  Previously, if the blob wrapper was published for a content object
  that did not derive from the provided image class, Plone's default
  ``index_html`` template would be used, rendering an HTML page
  instead of the image.
  [malthe]


1.5.1 (2011-08-19)
------------------

- ATImage adapter should take care of cases where no image was uploaded.
  [gotcha]

  blob fields.
  [davisagli]

- Fix broken migration-forms.
  [WouterVH]


1.1 (2010-08-13)
----------------

  [jbaach, witsch]

- Allow explicitly setting a mimetype via a keyword passed to the mutator.
  [davidblewett, kleist, witsch]

-------------------

  or 'image'.
  [regebro]

- The `ImageField` could not be copied, which broke the standard way of
  subclassing archetypes schemas.
  [regebro]

- Migration screen tried to check for installation via quick installer. We
  check the product of the destination portal type instead now. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10365.
  [dunlapm, hannosch]

- Enable "Image" replacement content type by default.
  [witsch]

- Don't break when image-specific methods are accidentally used on
  "File" content.
  [witsch]


1.0b16 (2010-05-02)
-------------------

- Remove existing image scales when updating blob-aware image fields.
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10455
  [frisi]

- Correct dependency on plone.app.imaging to >1.0b9 since we need the
  new IImageScaleFactory feature.
  [wichert]

  This refs http://plone.org/products/plone.app.blob/issues/10
  [witsch]

- Try to re-fetch blobs that have been removed from a client-side ZEO cache
  before giving up and raising an error.  This makes it possible to control
  the client blob cache size via external processes (e.g. `cron`) even with
  ZODB 3.8.  See http://dev.plone.org/plone/changeset/32170/ for more info.
  [svincic, witsch]

- Fix issue with incorrect values for "Type" catalog index after migration.
  [yomatters, witsch]


1.0b10 (2009-12-03)
-------------------

- Add support for accessing image scales via path expressions like
  `here/image_thumb` for backward-compatibility.
  [witsch]


1.0b9 (2009-11-26)
------------------

- Unify the ATBlob factories (for CMF>=2.2 and CMF<2.2) while still
  preventing events from being fired for the former.
  [witsch]

- Fix range support for open ranges.
  [j23d, witsch]

- Make the title field non-required for ATBlobs, since it will be
  generated from the filename if necessary.
  [davisagli]

- If a title was entered, use it instead of the filename to generate an
  id for files (matching what was already done for images).
  [davisagli]

- Update the CMF 2.2 version of the ATBlob factory to match a fix I made
  in Archetypes 2.0a2.
  [davisagli]

  CMF 2.2.

  http://plone.org/products/plone.app.blob/issues/11
  [j23d, rossp, witsch]

- Fix image field validator to match that from `ATContentTypes`.
  [rossp]

- With `ATContentTypes` >=2.0, check the `_should_set_id_to_filename`
  method to determine if `ATBlob`'s `fixAutoId` method should set the
  item id to the filename of the blob field.  For images, don't set it
  to the filename if a title was supplied.
  [davisagli]

- Add blobbable adapters for Python file objects and OFS Pdata objects.
  [davisagli]

- Add helper view to get a rough estimate of the total size of binary
  content in a site.

  been quick-installed yet.  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8496

- Preserve filename when editing via WebDAV.  This fixes
  http://plone.org/products/plone.app.blob/issues/23

  http://plone.org/products/plone.app.blob/issues/24

  transformations.  This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8506
  [amleczko, witsch]

  replacement types using the "cmf_edit" method.
  [alecm]

  404s for content other than images.  This fixes the second issue
  related to http://plone.org/products/plone.app.blob/issues/19
  [witsch]


1.0b4 (2009-11-19)
------------------

- Provide maintenance view for (re)setting blob sub-types, which can also
  be used to fix things after upgrading from 1.0b2 or earlier.
  This fixes http://plone.org/products/plone.app.blob/issues/19
  [witsch]

  references between instance and field, which broke pickling.
  [witsch]

  [hannosch]

  i.e. "File" and "Image", but not custom types.  This fixes
  http://plone.org/products/plone.app.blob/issues/3
  [witsch]

- Fix issue where the mime-type registry returned an empty tuple when
  looking up an unknown mime-type.  This fixes
  http://plone.org/products/plone.app.blob/issues/1
  [witsch]


1.0b2 (2008-02-29)
------------------

- Reverted fix for Windows that closed the file upload object in order
  to work around a problem with reading from the blob file afterwards.
  [witsch]

------------------

- Minor bug fixes and cleanups
  [witsch]

  [rochael]

- Change file size calculation so as not to need to reopen the file, which
  broke on Windows
  [rochael]

  [witsch]

- Initial package structure.
  [zopeskel]
