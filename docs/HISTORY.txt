  [davisagli]

  References http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9981
  [spliter]

  [witsch]


1.0b11 - 2010-01-30
-------------------

- Fix issues regarding migration from `OFS.File` and `OFS.Image` content.
  [optilude, witsch]

- Revert changes to make things more robust in case of missing blob files.
  This refs http://plone.org/products/plone.app.blob/issues/10
  [witsch]

- Try to re-fetch blobs that have been removed from a client-side ZEO cache
  before giving up and raising an error.  This makes it possible to control
  the client blob cache size via external processes (e.g. `cron`) even with
  ZODB 3.8.  See http://dev.plone.org/plone/changeset/32170/ for more info.
  [svincic, witsch]

  [yomatters, witsch]


1.0b10 - 2009-12-03
-------------------

- Add support for accessing image scales via path expressions like
  `here/image_thumb` for backward-compatibility.
  [witsch]


1.0b9 - 2009-11-26
------------------

- Unify the ATBlob factories (for CMF>=2.2 and CMF<2.2) while still
  preventing events from being fired for the former.
  [witsch]

- Fix range support for open ranges.
  [j23d, witsch]

- Make the title field non-required for ATBlobs, since it will be
  generated from the filename if necessary.
  [davisagli]

- If a title was entered, use it instead of the filename to generate an
  id for files (matching what was already done for images).
  [davisagli]

- Update the CMF 2.2 version of the ATBlob factory to match a fix I made
  in Archetypes 2.0a2.
  [davisagli]


1.0b8 - 2009-11-17
------------------

- Added a modified version of the customized ATBlob factory for use with
  CMF 2.2.
  [davisagli]

  boolean True.
  [davisagli]

- Implement range support for downloads.  This fixes
  http://plone.org/products/plone.app.blob/issues/11
  [j23d, rossp, witsch]

- Fix image field validator to match that from `ATContentTypes`.
  [rossp]

- With `ATContentTypes` >=2.0, check the `_should_set_id_to_filename`
  method to determine if `ATBlob`'s `fixAutoId` method should set the
  item id to the filename of the blob field.  For images, don't set it
  to the filename if a title was supplied.
  [davisagli]

- Add blobbable adapters for Python file objects and OFS Pdata objects.
  [davisagli]

- Add helper view to get a rough estimate of the total size of binary
  content in a site.

  been quick-installed yet.  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8496
  [witsch]

- Preserve filename when editing via WebDAV.  This fixes
  http://plone.org/products/plone.app.blob/issues/23
  [witsch]

- Update basic blob content type to be LinguaPlone-aware.  This fixes
  http://plone.org/products/plone.app.blob/issues/24
  [j23d]

- Override helper method to provide file-like objects for image
  transformations.  This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8506
  [amleczko, witsch]

- Add some additional CMF/ATCT compatibility to the ATCT
  replacement types using the "cmf_edit" method.
  [alecm]

- Speed up migration of existing content by using "in-place" migrators
  and avoid unnecessary re-indexing.
  [witsch]

  related to http://plone.org/products/plone.app.blob/issues/19
  [witsch]


1.0b4 - 2009-11-19
------------------

- Provide maintenance view for (re)setting blob sub-types, which can also
  be used to fix things after upgrading from 1.0b2 or earlier.
  This fixes http://plone.org/products/plone.app.blob/issues/19
  [witsch]


1.0b3 - 2009-11-15
------------------

  references between instance and field, which broke pickling.
  [witsch]

- Fix helper for determining image sizes to not break for non-image
  content.
  [witsch]

  certain types of JPEGs.
  [witsch]

- Added missing metadata.xml to the default profile.
  [hannosch]

- Only use the file name for id generation for the replacement types,
  i.e. "File" and "Image", but not custom types.  This fixes
  http://plone.org/products/plone.app.blob/issues/3
  [witsch]

- Fix issue where the mime-type registry returned an empty tuple when
  looking up an unknown mime-type.  This fixes
  http://plone.org/products/plone.app.blob/issues/1
  [witsch]


1.0b2 - 2008-02-29
------------------

- Reverted fix for Windows that closed the file upload object in order
  to work around a problem with reading from the blob file afterwards.
  [witsch]


1.0b1 - 2008-02-28
------------------

- Minor bug fixes and cleanups
  [witsch]

- Fix for a problem regarding file uploads on Windows, where renaming
  the still open temporary file isn't allowed and hence caused an error.
  Now the file is closed before the call to `consumeFile()`.
  [rochael]

- Fix for Windows regarding the generation of the temporary file used for
  file uploads so that it doesn't get deleted after being moved to the
  blob storare
  [rochael]

- Change file size calculation so as not to need to reopen the file, which
  broke on Windows
  [rochael]

- Changed the primary field of the blob content types to not to be
  "searchable" as this causes indexing of the blob content making ram
  consumption go through the roof
  [witsch]


1.0a2 - 2007-12-12
------------------

- Various minor bug fixes regarding migration, content icons etc
  [witsch]
